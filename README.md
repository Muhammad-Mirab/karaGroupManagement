# ☘️ karaGroupManagement
A feature-rich group management telegram bot that's in early stages of development ☘️

the bot is expected to have every feature a full group management website has, it's expected to be in two languages(persian, english, and I may add french later on myself) right now(I'm open to integrate into more if someone would translate the language file)
